# PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage - July 2024

## Introduction
I recently completed the PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage in July 2024, where I honed my Power BI skills to better understand and meet clients' data visualization needs. Through this program, I developed three distinct dashboards, each addressing specific business problems. These projects allowed me to showcase my ability to analyze data, communicate insights effectively, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Problem Statements

### 1. Customer Retention Dashboard
**Problem:** The telecom retention department faced challenges in identifying customers at risk of terminating their contracts proactively. Historical analysis in Excel often ended in dead-ends, necessitating a clear and self-explanatory visualization for management.  
**Solution:** Created a Power BI dashboard to highlight customers at risk of churn, enabling proactive retention efforts through clear visual indicators and predictive metrics.
